# are you ?
# # Hello friend

# ------------------------------------

# are you ?
# Readme.md:

# Ok so I think the idea of q=swap(extend) is not working because I have like capslock
# as an extra modifier. espace too as an extra modifier. right alt as an extra modifier
# and space as an extra modifier too... so my best bet is to use oneshots effeciintly
# and to just remove my hand from the thing. or sometimes don't make like you know
# like right alt shouldn't have anyting to do with win_shoftcut Thing for activating 
# windows right? so like yeah dedicate proper shit to proper stuff... and soo yeah.


# DO:

## This is an idea to make q=swap(extend) universal... kinda
# - [ ] Wait, it's possible to make every modifier in [main] that is significant like ca
# psloc and space and rightalt and escape has it's own swap escape back to q... default 
# like [extend]... like when you swap to a layer and return to the main one in capslock 
# with q=swap(extend)... right... but it gets ..... Anyways... what I want to do is. 
# let's say, [like_extend] the swaps I make a new copy of the swaps. and just change the
# q=swap(extend) to q=swap(like_extend)... and that's it. I'll have doublicates but it 
# should work. this way I can maintain the swap thing and make q universal exit


# Suggetions:
# - idk for now, maybe clean up this config it's too big and repititave and most things
# I don't really use tbh

# - well I have q=swap(extned) right... I can make like ] or another key for space for s
# wap back to space thing... idk... tbh Ideally capslock and space should be the same...
# really? should they ? i'm not sure tbh... idk this needs more work... and like Obsidian

# like I should ask questions why do it this way and not everything in one key idk



# Sidenote: 

## side note if you plug your red keyboard it won't work here. to make it work here you need to put it's keycode in here.

## but why put it's keycode here? unless keyd can make the 2nd keyboard act

## differently ike AHK interception, I'm not planing to write using the 2nd keyboard. soyeah.

## just trying to increase optins and know how to achieve AHK interception on linux I guess

## I like the idea of putting timer next to it

# this is alright, I don't use it but, just incase I need rightalt's keycode and also

# be better. but i'm not sure



# leftalt+rightalt = layer(rightalt)
#2 --- Ideas ---- 
#just some ideas for [main] section. Maybe in the future to help improve the ergonomic project


# --- potential layer() mappings ---- 

# why do I need to do this ?
# umm this where like my rightshift inside the xdotool will be interesting to use
# but I know the problem with --clearmodifiers let's just work slowly and see what's
# gonna happen in the future 
# rightalt = layer(rightshift)



# this is another option instead of rightshift to have meta really close to your
# thumb for ease of use but I still value shift more I think.. for now
# rightalt = rightmeta

# leftmeta = rightmeta
# leftmeta = rightmeta




# This is not perfect the layer(rightshift) will kill the keycose I won't be able to
# see it sadly no [alt] or no [rightalt] is provided and so. if I want to make it 
# like [alt] in which in that section there is apostrophe = " I would have to make a
# whole layer sadly and I tried other things... but who knows maybe in the future I 
# will know a fix ? i'm not sure
# rightalt = layer(rightshift)

# this kinda solves it but I don't want rightalt to be leftalt
# rightalt = layer(alt)


# ----- This is how you hit 2 keys at the same time for extra options ----
# just learned this today W32 Sat, 16 at 14:51 it actually works


# wow this is also valid but it has to be hit really fast
# leftalt+p = "



# --- this is how to make a leader ----

# rightalt = oneshot(shift)

# leftshift = oneshot(shift)
# rightshift = oneshot(shift)

# compose = oneshot(meta)

## btw just a side note this --> `rightalt = overload(oneshot(shift), noop)` is stupid and doesn't work

## a side note don't do `leftalt = layer(alt)` it's the default anywher. it's in here but you can't see it. it's default

# control = oneshot(control)
