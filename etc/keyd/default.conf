# [[keyd]]




# DESCRIPTION:  This is config for keyd, it is aimed to help the user integrate
#               some VIM motion aspecs and also useful ergonomic keyboard
#               centric workflow. It is very well though and has been worked
#               on as I go. It has Dvorak as well and qwerty switch.
#               all in one config

# Why?: For coding longer without hand strain, for useful shortcuts that save
#       time and energy. also to make using the computer more pleasurable
#       fun, interesting and effective. 

# Extra info (Do not read just yapping):

# keyd is really useful, It works and at a lower level so this means if you make
# your own keyboard configuration you can always have it with you all the time
# on other programs even inside a VM and inside a VM's programs or KVM swticher
# keyd is a very important program for programmers it makes the keyboard what 
# you want. 

# The goal of this config is to not make something very complex but through trial
# and erorr and a lot of monkeytype and testing to make something that is universal
# set it up 1 time and never have to set it up again. something that is very well
# thought out.

# this keyd configuration is aimed at people who already know VIM motion and
# know Dvorak the real programmer dvorak one from the primegen where the symbols
# are changed to have this pattern +[{(&=)}]*!| at the numbers keys which is far
# superior than the patern ~!@#$%^&*()_+ with shift+numbers. also the design of
# dvorak is nice. But don't worry with capslock+q for qwerty and capslock+w for
# dvorak you can switch whenever you feel like switching. Idealy you want to not 
# use qwerty but you know it's an option there in the case of you wanting to give
# your computer to someone else or you want to write in qwerty for some reason. 
# maybe those keyboard responsibilities got the heck out of you and you built a 
# habit. anyways you do you

# It is also aimed at people who know vim and aimed for power users who use drop
# down terminals too and such. like alacrity with tdrop or ghostty with tdrop
# and also qterminal for that lightweight qterminal -d. this is aimed for linux users
# I don't think it's possible to replicate on windows with AHK

# --------------------------------------------------------------------

# MAP:
#
# core: extend | space_typist | rightalt_symbols | dvorak | escape_extend 
#
# extend:
# helps the user deal with programs and shortcuts, also helps in everything
#
# space_typist:
# helps the user with dealing with numbers and math. 
#
# righalt_extra:
# helps the user deal with symbols
#
# dvorak:
# helps the user write code for very long amounts of time with no or little hand
# strain
#
# escape_extend:
# helps the user open very frequent paths in file explorer or programs that the
# user knows he will open constantly like thunar recent...etc and other potential
# scripts or in the case where xbindkeys keys are full to run commands. something
# like this...etc. As an emergincy if everything is full which is rare.
#
# utility: alt | move_to_desktops
#
# alt: 
# changes when holding alt behavior to make certain plays possible
#
# move_to_desktops:
# Makes moving between 40 desktops smart
#


[ids]
# The id of the keyboard that keyd will affect. which means you can have a 2nd 
# keyboard and not include it in here and it will act ok.
# I do not know if I can make certain id behave differently like in AHI library
# in AHK. 

# I think this one is for my bluetooth keyboard
248a:00da

# I think this one is for my red cheap gaming old keyboard
0001:0001



[global]
# The goal of this gloval is to make life with tapping modifiers easier and flexable
# All you need are those 2 var and that's it. 
# But maybe in the future I change opinion

# time until a oneshot will stop being oneshot
