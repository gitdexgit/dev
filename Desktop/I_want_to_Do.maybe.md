What to do after you wake up 

- go to _c_ you now termux config and go to keyd and let's make something happen with space
- make space you know better numbers...
- tbh I still like rightalt numbers but oh man the bnm,./ are really hard to hit but jkl;huiop are easy tbh the easiet are jkl;iop so I leave those with number right and use those as never mind I'll just use nhjkuiol;p maybe even 90- anyways this is just for nvim jumping with right alt you know it's one hand thing you know just hold alt and type numbers within 2 digits very easy and yeah and umm space will be proper like hey I'm going to type like proper numbers ... but wait I kinda can instead of hitting right alt right right thumb it's more easy to just hit space with right thumb and that's going to be nmhjkl;uiiop those are easy to hit with space so those will be the mubers... and for right alt I mean meh man maybe we use it for like symbols or something anyways 5 I do still like the double right alt tap it's really nice so yeah it is what it is
