# { key = "End",      mods = "Alt", action = "ScrollToBottom" },

# # Bind Ctrl+PageDown to scroll down by a single line.

# === CUSTOM BINDINGS YOU REQUESTED ===
##!!!!!!!!!!!! never ever do this... this will ruin nvim and also it's not universal... just adapt man adopt i as tab and ignore C-h but also add C-;




# C-, sends tab (\t)
# { key = ",", mods = "Control", chars = "\t" },

# C-i sends nothing (disables tab behavior)
# { key = "I", mods = "Control", chars = "" },
