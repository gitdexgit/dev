# for inject to work you need umm to apply_patch or something = true or false or whatever
# then turn inject... idk if inject will make me type better in like nvim... it's probably
# better for like short trigger and replace but for like long amount of text, clipboard is the meta 
# I think or not maybe I'm wrong.
# just disable this if you need clipboard whatever man then when typing just like enable it....

# ----------- ai start----------

# ai told me that I can do this

# backend: Clipboard

# Use the super-fast inject backend ONLY for specific apps where it excels.
# app_specific:
#   # For all terminal emulators on Linux (adapt names if needed)
#   - matches:
#       - app_class: "Alacritty"
#       - app_class: "kitty"
#       - app_class: "gnome-terminal"
#     backend: inject
#     apply_patch: false # Good practice to pair this with inject

# but it doens't work, I've just tested it 

# ----------- ai end ----------


# it's too fast if I do this it makes it not that fast and it actually makes it bad 
# I don't like it I think making it fast is good 
# disable_x11_fast_inject: true

# sadly the inject backend isn't working well with the idk the ;;gc# and what not
# idk I'll use inject for now
# but I don't use the #gc... parts that much and I can just make them into a snippets anyways so, I can also type them
