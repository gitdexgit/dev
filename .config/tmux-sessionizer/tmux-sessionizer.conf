# This file defines the list of commands for tmux-sessionizer's -s flag.

# config file example
# ------------------------
# # file: ~/.config/tmux-sessionizer/tmux-sessionizer.conf
# # If set this override the default TS_SEARCH_PATHS (~/ ~/personal ~/personal/dev/env/.config)
# TS_SEARCH_PATHS=(~/)
# # If set this add additional search paths to the default TS_SEARCH_PATHS
# # The number prefix is the depth for the Path [OPTIONAL]
# TS_EXTRA_SEARCH_PATHS=(~/ghq:3 ~/Git:3 ~/.config:2)
# # if set this override the TS_MAX_DEPTH (1)
# TS_MAX_DEPTH=2
# This is not meant to override .tmux-sessionizer.  At first i thought this
# would be a good command, but i don't think its ackshually what i want.
#
# Instead, its a list of commands to run on windows who's index is way outside
# of the first 10 windows.  This allows you to create as many windows in your
# session as you would like without having your workflow interrupted by these
# programatic windows
#
# how to use:
# tmux-sessionizer -w 0 will execute the first command in window -t 69.
# TS_SESSION_COMMANDS=(<cmd1> <cmd2>)
#
# TS_LOG=true # will write logs to ~/.local/share/tmux-sessionizer/tmux-sessionizer.logs
# TS_LOG_FILE=<file> # will write logs to <file> Defaults to ~/.local/share/tmux-sessionizer/tmux-sessionizer.logs
# ------------------------




# TS_SESSION_COMMANDS is a list.
# Index 0 corresponds to -s 0 (your Alt+h)
# Index 1 corresponds to -s 1 (your Alt+t)
# and so on...
